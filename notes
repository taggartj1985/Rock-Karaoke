create rooms, songs and guests
check in guests to rooms/check out guests from rooms
add songs to rooms

venue* = maybe another class to get venue money.
rooms = capacity of room(maybe), add songs to room
guests = money(extenstion) mvp just basically name to check in and out
songs = just a list of songs (artist, song_title)

need an array for some pda *done*


should i create a venue as a super class?

by doing this i could make the guest venue_fee go through it
could create a bar/food and keep track of rooms.
